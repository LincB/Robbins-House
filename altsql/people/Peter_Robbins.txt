Peter Robbins~1~1~10~Peter Robbins, described as the \"big burly son of Caesar Robbins,\" was part of the first generation born into freedom. In 1824, Peter married Fatima Oliver of Acton. In 1837, Fatima sued for divorce because Peter was having a relationship with her cousin, Almira Oliver Davis, who already had five children with Peter. Fatima received the west room on the house. Peter and Almira had thirteen children together, but only one son and six daughters lived to adulthood. Peter and Almira most likely moved back into the house after Fatima left prior to 1850. Peter died of consumption, in 1855.~~~~~~~~~~*Children of Peter Robbins~5~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Kate Boaz~8~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Fatima Oliver~5~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Almira Oliver Davis~8~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Susan Robbins Garrison~10~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Humphrey Barrett~5~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Civil War ~6~~~~~~~~~~~~*Caesar Robbins~10~~~~~~~*Daniel Shattuck~3~~~~~~*Family of Caesar Robbins~10~~~~~*Welcome to The Robbins House Interpretative Center~10~~~~*
