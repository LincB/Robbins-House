Caesar Robbins~1~1~10~Born in 1746 into slavery, Caesar Robbins served in the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War probably in place of his owner. By 1776 he was a soldier during the Revolutionary War with the forces that fortified Dorchester Heights and later as part of Captain Zachariah Fitch\'s company, marching to Fort Ticonderoga. He was most likely emancipated before or at the time of his enlistment in the militia. He settled in Concord, married twice and had six children. Although born a slave, Caesar Robbins fought for the freedom of his new country. Patriarch of the Robbins family, his children, Susan and Peter became the first residents of this house.~~~~~~~~*Simon Hunt~1~~~~~~~~~~~*Captain Zachariah Fitch~1~~~~~~~~~~~*Susan Robbins Garrison~10~~~~~~~~~~~*Mary Robbins~5~~~~~~~~~~~*Humphrey Barrett~5~~~~~~~~~~~*Peter Robbins~10~~~~~~~~~~~*Phylis~3~~~~~~~~~~~*Revolutionary War~4~~~~~~~~~~*Family of Caesar Robbins~10~~~~~~~~~*Welcome to The Robbins House Interpretative Center~10~~~~~*Ellen Garrison~10~~~~*
