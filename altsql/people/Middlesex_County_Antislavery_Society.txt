Middlesex County Antislavery Society~1~1~8~The membership of the society, which included both men and women, represented  towns all around Middlesex County.  A number of Concord people joined, among  them Mary Merrick Brooks (who served on the nominating committee and as  secretary of the organization), carriage maker William Whiting (a Main Street  neighbor of Mrs. Brooks and president of the society), Dr. Josiah Bartlett,  Helen and Sophia Thoreau (sisters of Henry David Thoreau), Monument Street  farmer Minot Pratt; and minister John Wilder.  Meetings were held in rotation in  various Middlesex locations, Concord included.   In 1838 and 1839, antislavery organizations in New England were thrown into  turmoil by disagreement over aspects of abolitionist leader William Lloyd  Garrison\'s radical stance, particularly his promotion of women\'s active, voting  involvement at meetings.  Conservative clergymen and others who found it  difficult to accept an equal role for men and women broke from Garrison\'s New  England Antislavery Society to form their own organization (the Massachusetts  Abolition Society).  The Garrisonians were subsequently referred to as the \"old  orgs,\" the dissenters as the \"new orgs.\"  See CFPLhttp://www.concordlibrary.org/scollect/antislavery/02a_essay.html ~~~~~~~~~~*John Wilder~6~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Colonel William Whiting~4~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Minot Pratt~5~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Josiah Bartlett~5~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Sophia Thoreau~8~~~~~~~~~~~~~*Helen Louisa Thoreau~8~~~~~~~~~~~~~*George Thompson~3~~~~~~~~~~~*William Lloyd Garrison~8~~~~~~~~~~*Abolitionists~10~~~~~~~~*Mary Merrick Brooks~9~~~~*
