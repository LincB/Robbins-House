Peter Hutchinson~1~1~10~The last African-American owner of the Robbins House was Peter Hutchinson. A distant cousin of Peter Robbins\' wife, he and his wife married at the African Meeting House in Boston and had six children. Peter \"had more local knowledge of woods lots and meadow bounds than any man in town, and much of it died with him\", according to J.S. Keyes. He was a laborer for many people around town, Thoreau referred to him as Concord\'s \"dexterous pig butcher\". During his time in the  Robbins House, the farm lane became known as Peter\'s Path, the woods nearby were called Peter Hutchinson\'s Woods, a spring as known as Peter\'s Spring, and Emerson wrote a poem called Peter\'s Field.~*The Hutchinson Family~6~~~~*Daniel Shattuck~2~~~~*Susan Robbins Garrison~10~~~~*Henry David Thoreau~10~~~~*Ellen Garrison~10~~~~*Welcome to The Robbins House Interpretative Center~10~~~~*Underground Railroad~6~~~~*Ralph Waldo Emerson~6~~~~*
