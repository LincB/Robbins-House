Zilpah White~1~1~5~Zilpah White, who, with no money to buy land or seed, squatted near Walden Pond and managed to survive alone for forty years. “People talked of her as a witch,” Lemire says. “Zilpah had her garden, spun linen, kept chickens, and probably bartered. Once, one of Thoreau’s friends went ice fishing and gave her a fish.” Zilpah’s cabin was not unlike Thoreau’s, but she “was forced to go one step further than even Henry ever did,” Lemire writes, “because she had only the thin strip by the side of the road on which to squat. She used her one room as both her residence and her barn. She housed not only her dogs and cats in her ‘hut,’ as one local resident called her home, but her hens as well.”
