Fugitive Slave Act of 1850~1~1~7~The Fugitive Slave Law required Northerners to return of self-emancipatied former slaves. Penalties for refusing to aid in the capture of runaways could include a six months jail term or a fine up to $1000. The Fugitive Slave Act brought home the issue of slavery to Concordians. What had been a distant  southern problem was now a northern issue. Many people, like Emerson, who had been against slavery were motivated to become ardent abolitionists.~*Thomas Sims~5~~~~*Antony Burns~5~~~~*Ralph Waldo Emerson~6~~~~*
