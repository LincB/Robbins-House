John Jack~1~1~5~Born in Africa, John Jack was enslaved until his early forties, when his owner died. John Jack worked various jobs saving enough money to buy 8.5 acres of land. He was the first former enslaved person to purchase land in Concord (see #25). Before his death in 1773, John Jack bequeathed land to his female partner, who was forced to turn the land over to her white master. Daniel Bliss, Esq., a local Tory from a slaveholding family composed an epitaph for John Jack that castigated local Patriots for calling themselves Britain’s slaves even as they, themselves, were slaveholders.~~~~~~~*Mary Rice~6~~~~~~~~~~*Other African American residents of Concord~7~~~~*
